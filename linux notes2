static code analysis is the process is before code is being run static becuse a code is not running,it is done by analyzing set of instruction by using some coding standerds provided by automation tool this kind of anylasis is help full for to identify the loop calls in the source code they moight be hurmfull.
multithreding
linux is supporting ha sgot addvanced michanisam to block on multiple reads and multipal writes symaltenously.
select();--> using this call its allowing to program read and write multiple.here thne logic is evry time check for rediness of the file discrepter for corresponding IO opration and it can moniter max of <  FD_SETSIZE--> 1024

sys/select.h

--> first system call -->select(int n fds(--> fd_set,read,write,error))--> struct timeval *timeout--> telling system call to test for this  mini fds.--> fd_set is a  data type that ha smultiple fds.-->
select system call wait untill time out its block file discrepter ready for read and write opration performing read and write return value 0.an danother case in -->-1.
