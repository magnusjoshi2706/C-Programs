User Manual Gamezone --> this program is for user manual for gamezone.
                        in this program i have used so many basic concepts like switch case, goto statements, labels etc, functions etc.... this program is                         not complete yet i want to add more functinality in it. like the program is direclty transfer in to game and run the game                                   automatic. i am working on it ....
                        
Student data using struct----> here i have created one simple structure and stored all students information in it and last i have print all the information                                of the students....

students results and declered top students--------->  here i have created one struct and stored the value in it. here i have used for loop taking the input                                                       by the user and then there i used temp logic for assending order marks. so it can show top students                                                         list after succesfull the program.

stored data is main imporantant in c. there i have use malloc,calloc and simple array for storing elements one by one there i used goto for loop and switch                                                       case etc....
